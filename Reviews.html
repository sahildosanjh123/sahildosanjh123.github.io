  <h2>
    A little Bit about us
  </h2>
  <div class="pht">
    My parents Rajwinder and Lakhpreet were very poor when they came for India, when they came from India they had 20 dollars and had already made living arrangements. My dad got a job as a dishwasher and my mom was a waitress and "Lalu Man Sweets and Restaurants" 
    and they worked there for SEVEN YEARS. Thats when my dad really started getting into the food industry , and after all those years being a dishwasher he applied for being the cashier at "100 resturant". All the owner saw was a man working hard for
    a living, and after that, a position as a sales person opend up at the same place and he applied and got the job.After working hard there the ceo of the restaurant promoted him to the manager while my mom was at home taking care of  me she sacrificed her freedom for me and that is pretty awesome and for all of the kids out there that say that there parents don't spend enough time for them . Your parents are out there making sacrifieces for you so that you have a bright and easy life when you grow up. As for my dad's story he continued being a manger until we had enough saved up for us to open uo the soon to be <a href="going to make a link still">Desi Ghar</a> that is how out favorite restaurant came to be in our world.
