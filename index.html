As you can see we like to have a very old timey style for our restaurant this is how they used to be in India and we would like to bring that back so the new generations of Indians still have something to go back on.

As you can see this is the Golden Temple , this is one of the most iconic holy places in all of punjab.You may be wondering why is the picture on here well it's here because there is a thing called langar hall this is where people come to eat and it is almost like a charity they give food to everyone and anyone is welcome to eat and if you have no where to stay they also provide shelter. Thats what we like to do we give all the left overs to homeless people that are hungry.
